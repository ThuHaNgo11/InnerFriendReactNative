Mongodb user password: nS4A0GEs1h0UfUvG

Module 1: Sign up, sign in
1. dependencies for user authentication: bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
2. define user model (name, email, password)
3. create sign up route: 
    - receive user input, 
    - validate data, 
    - hash password using bcrypt, 
    - create a new user in the db
    - generate a jwt to authenticate user

4. create sign in route:
    - receive user's credentials
    - verify against stored user data
    - generate a jwt if valid

5. implement authentication middleware: verify jwt

6. client-side integration: 
    - create sign up and sign in forms
    - make http requests to corresponding routes to authenticate
    - store the received jwt (in local storage or cookies) to authenticate subsequent requests
